## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Gmail account for sending emails
- Cloudinary account for image hosting

### Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Extract the zip file
cd college-event-manager

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend (.env in server folder)

Create `server/.env` file:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/college-event-manager
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Gmail Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

#### Frontend (.env in client folder)

The file is already created:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Step 3: Gmail App Password Setup

1. Go to Google Account settings: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to App Passwords: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Create new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password
6. Paste it in `.env` as `EMAIL_PASS`

### Step 4: Cloudinary Setup

1. Sign up at https://cloudinary.com (free tier)
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Copy Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
4. Paste them in `.env`
5. Upload event images or use provided URLs

### Step 5: Start MongoDB

```bash
# If using local MongoDB
mongod

# If using MongoDB Atlas, just use the connection string in .env
```

### Step 6: Seed Database with Dummy Data

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

This creates:
- 1 Admin account
- 5 Dummy events with details

**Admin Credentials:**
- Email: admin@college.edu
- Password: admin123

### Step 7: Run the Application

#### Terminal 1 - Backend
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
Backend runs on http://localhost:5000

#### Terminal 2 - Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm start
```
Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000

4. **OTP**: OTP expires in 10 minutes. Request a new one if expired.

5. **QR Codes**: Generated uniquely for each registration with user and event details embedded.

1. Set all environment variables
2. Use MongoDB Atlas for database
3. Update FRONTEND_URL to your deployed frontend URL

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Set REACT_APP_API_URL to your backend URL
3. Deploy build folder

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue: Can't login after registration**
- Solution: Make sure you verified OTP. Check email spam folder.

**Issue: Images not loading**
- Solution: Upload images to your Cloudinary account and update URLs.

**Issue: Email not sending**
